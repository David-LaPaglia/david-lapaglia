            <h3>Support Vector Machine</h3>
            <p>Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.</p>
            <p>SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are robust to overfitting, especially in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.</p>
            <p>In this project, I used SVMs to classify climate-related text data. The SVM model was trained on the preprocessed data, and the performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of how my cm looks:</p>

            <p>Then I remembered my applied machine learning class where I can use sklearn's grid search cv, to find the best possible hyperparameters (those tiny settings) so I did so, and I got the best results for this module so far:  </p>

            <p>As you can see, the SVM model performed better than the Decision Tree model, and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, but there is still room for improvement.</p>
            <p>45% was the best accuracy I found between all my models. The differences between these two SVMs are big, one uses a linear kernel and the other a radial bias function kernel, for more dynamic data. I also decreased the regularization when I got 45% accuracy.</p>
            <p>Despite all of this, I would argue still, that I need to review and regather more data based on more distinct labels.</p>

            <h4>Sentiment Analysis:</h4>
            <p>In addition to classification, I also performed sentiment analysis on the text data using SVMs. The goal was to determine the sentiment (positive, negative) expressed in the text related to climate change.</p>
            <p>Sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion and attitudes towards climate-related issues. The SVM model was trained on (manually) labeled sentiment data, and the performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of how my cm looks:</p>
            <img src="images/svm/Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 11.24.05 PM.png" alt="SVM Sentiment Analysis Confusion Matrix" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p>The issue with manually labeling data is that as a human, I carry inhernent bais. That can massively lead to analysis that isn't 100% factual.</p>
            <img src="images/svm/Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 11.30.07 PM.png" alt="SVM Sentiment Analysis Confusion Matrix" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
            <p>Garbage in, garbage out. This sentiment analysis is proof of good data leading to good results and the ability for the model to learn well becomes evident.</p>
