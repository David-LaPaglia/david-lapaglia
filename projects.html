    <h3>My Projects</h3>
    <div class="resume">
        
        <h4>An in-depth analysis of career data, pitted against the demands of academia.</h4>
        <p>This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project using Python's requests module, BeautifulSoup, PANDAS, and Seaborn to explore skills gained through my major and the skills most sought-after in the job market.</p>

        <h4>Data Visualization and Exploration of Greenhouse Emissions and Other Pollutants</h4>
        <p>Analysis of Greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. This project focused on cleaning data and using the Altair module to visualize information.</p>

        <h4>Convolutional Neural Network + SVM Project</h4>
        <p>This was an image classification machine learning model. The data source was images from the internet of red, green and yellow lights, that I then regularized and normalized. This project was about creating two models and comparing between the effacacy of a neural network and a white-box SVM model from sci-kit learn.</p>

        <h4>Beats and Bytes: Decoding the Data Behind Song Popularity</h4>
        <p>This group project was an interesting project using spotify data to try and answer the question what makes a song popular. A little bit of everything, some fidnings were that over time, energy in songs has decreases. This project was really interesting in exploring data through music.</p>

        <h4>Credit Card Fraud Classification</h4>
        <p>This is another machine learning project that took +100k rows of credit card infromation with the intention of creating a model that can detect credit card fraud. I used both a KNN and SVM to compare and contrast the effacacy of the different models. It ended up reaching a 96% accuracy and F1 score.</p>
