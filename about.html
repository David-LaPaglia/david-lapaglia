    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>As a Data Manager, I contribute to NOAA’s mission of environmental stewardship by managing and organizing critical datasets related to passive ocean acoustics. My role involves ensuring data accuracy, writing Python scripts to aid in data manager duties, maintaining databases, and enhancing data visualization to make complex data more accessible and actionable.</p>
    <p>In addition, I work as an Undergraduate Assistant at the Center for Asian Studies (CAS), supporting the events coordinator and managing the CAS website. I handle various organizational tasks and responsibilities, such as recording grant money, survey engineering, and course data management and reporting throughout multiple departments. </p>
    <p>I am also pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, with minors in Chinese and Business. </p>
    <p>Recently I joined Dr. Evan Peck's research project, Visualization Islands. In this project I am applying data analytics skills and visualization design techniques to create an interactive article to display research findings and data collected.</p>
    <p>Through these experiences, I have developed a comprehensive skillset in data visualization, data science, data analysis, web development, and communication. I aim to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative, user-friendly solutions for diverse and talented teams. </p>
