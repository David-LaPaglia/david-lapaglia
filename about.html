        <h3>Time at CU Boulder</h3>
        <p>As a Jr. Data Manager at NOAA, I dedicated myself to advancing environmental stewardship through the power of data. I specialized in managing and archiving passive ocean acoustics datasets, and working on Python automation scripts. My work directly contributed to important marine conservation efforts by making environmental data more accessible and meaningful to researchers and decision-makers. I created artifcats that made learning our complex package ingest system more accessible for new team members.</p>
        
        <p>During my time at the Center for Asian Studies (CAS), I served as an Undergraduate Assistant where I managed the center's web presence, coordinated events, and oversaw critical data reporting across multiple departments. This role strengthened my ability to bridge technical implementation with clear communication while handling diverse responsibilities from grant management to survey engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, complemented by minors in Chinese and Business. This interdisciplinary background has uniquely positioned me at the intersection of technical expertise and global perspectiveâ€”essential for solving complex problems in today's interconnected world.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of my time at CU Boulder, I was honored by being inducted to the <strong>National Collegiate Chinese Honor Society</strong> for my dedication to the Chinese language and culture and for my academic achievements. Within the Information Science department, I was also recognized for my outstanding academic performance and leadership in the Information Science department. I was honored as the department's <strong>2025 William W. White Outstanding Senior</strong>. This award recognizes students who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievement, leadership, and service to the department, underscoring my commitment to both academic excellence and community engagement.</p>

        <h3>Skills & Approach</h3>
        <p>My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a versatile skillset spanning data visualization, statistical analysis, web development, and strategic communication. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my technical abilities to create intuitive, user-centered solutions that drive real-world impact.</p>
        
        <p>I approach challenges with creativity, analytical rigor, and a commitment to continuous learning. Whether I'm uncovering patterns in complex datasets or designing accessible interfaces, I'm passionate about creating solutions that are both technically sound and human-centered.</p>
        
        <p>I'm always open to discussing new opportunities and collaborations. Or, if you just want to talk about theories of how information permeates throughout our world, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:david.lapaglia@colorado.edu">david.lapaglia@colorado.edu</a>.</p>
