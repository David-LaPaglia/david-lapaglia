        <h1>What I've Learned: Text Mining Journey</h1>
        <p>Reflections and insights from exploring the world of text mining and climate discourse</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Looking Back on the Journey</h2>
        
        <div class="journey-section">
            <p>When I began this text mining project exploring climate change discourse, I had a technical goal in mind: to apply data science techniques to uncover patterns in unstructured text. </p>
         
        </div>
        
        <h2>Key Non-Technical Insights</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Different Worlds of Communication</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most striking discovery was how dramatically different the language is between various climate discourse communities. Scientists, activists, policymakers, and skeptics aren't merely disagreeing—they're often speaking entirely different languages. Terms that carry significant meaning in one community may be absent or have different connotations in another.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> The Power of Perspective</h3>
            <p>My analysis revealed how the same climate topics can be framed in radically different ways that evoke entirely different emotional responses. When environmental concerns are framed as economic opportunities versus regulatory burdens, it completely changes public reception—even when discussing identical issues.</p>
            <p>This awareness of framing has changed how I approach both consuming and creating content across all domains, making me more conscious of the subtle ways information presentation shapes our understanding.</p>
        </div>
        
   
        <div class="insight-card">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> The importance of Discourse</h3>
            <p>Text mining highlighted how easily we can become trapped in communication bubbles. The context that surrounds us shapes the perception of our enviornments and truths.The distinct vocabulary and narrative patterns in different communities create self-reinforcing information environments (sometimes misinforming). Breaking through these requires conscious effort and translation between different ways of speaking about issues, or open communication.</p>
            <p>I've become more aware of my own information bubble and now actively seek diverse perspectives, even on topics where I hold strong views.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="insight-card">
            <h3><i class="fas fa-tags"></i> The Foundation of Quality: Data Labeling Matters</h3>
            <p>One of the most profound lessons from this project was discovering just how crucial proper data labeling and quality are to the entire machine learning process. When I carefully labeled climate texts with lexicon-based approaches and manually reviewed examples, my models performed dramatically better than with automated or generic approaches. This also be a double egded sword in the sense that if I am programmatically labeling something and then letting a model to train on that data, there is a high chance that the model will just cling to the rules that I used to label.</p>
            <p>The old saying "garbage in, garbage out" took on new meaning—no matter how sophisticated my neural networks or algorithms became, they could never overcome fundamental data quality issues. Investing time in creating thoughtful, balanced(resampling), and representative training data yielded insights that would have remained hidden otherwise.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical accuracy, I learned that labeling decisions themselves embed values and perspectives that shape all downstream insights. The choices we make about what constitutes "positive" or "negative" sentiment in climate discourse, for example, aren't just technical decisions—they're interpretive acts that influence what patterns our models can discover.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quote-block">
            "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."
            <div class="quote-author">— Ludwig Wittgenstein</div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Inescapable Human Side of Data</h2>
        
        <p>While the technical aspects of this project were fascinating, what surprised me most was how deeply human the process of text mining became. Behind every word frequency, sentiment score, and topic model were real people communicating about issues that matter deeply to them.</p>
        
        <p>I discovered that text mining isn't just about extracting information—it's about understanding human communication, beliefs, and values. The patterns revealed in the data are ultimately patterns in how we think and communicate about our world.</p>
        
        <div class="personal-reflection">
            "Data science and humanities aren't separate worlds. This project showed me they're deeply interconnected. The best insights came when I combined rigorous analysis with human understanding. This underscroes the value of the Information Science department, studying how humans are directly responsbile for the data we create gives us insight into how to better ourselves."
        </div>
        
        <div class="next-steps">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-road"></i> Where Do I Go From Here?</h2>
            <p>This text mining journey has opened new paths I'm excited to explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploring how text analysis can bridge divides in other polarized topics</li>
                <li>Developing more accessible tools that help people become more aware of language patterns in media they consume</li>
                <li>Thinking of systems that are more conducive to open communication and open-mindedness.</li>
                <li>Creating better data labeling methodologies that balance efficiency with quality</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Final Reflections</h2>
        
        <p>Text mining climate discourse has taught me that communication is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity in addressing complex issues. Data can reveal patterns we might never notice otherwise, but interpreting those patterns requires human context and understanding.</p>
        
  
        
        <p>Beyond all the technical skills I've developed, the most valuable outcome of this project has been a deeper appreciation for the complexity of language from a computational perspective. I've also gained a profound respect for the often undervalued work of data preparation and labeling. I understand now what "Garbage in, garbage out" means.</p>
